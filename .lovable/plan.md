## Replace "Soul Food" in First Hero Slide Title

### Change

Update the first hero image title from **"Soul Food, Served with Pride"** to **"Elevated Southern Cuisine"** to better appeal to formal event clients (weddings, corporate functions, military ceremonies).

### Technical Detail

**File: `src/components/home/SplitHero.tsx`**

In the `heroImages` array, update the first entry's `title` property (around line 100):

- **From**: `"Soul Food, Served with Pride"`
- **To**: `"Elevated Southern Cuisine"`

No other files or images are affected. The subtitle ("Charleston's Premier Caterer") and description remain unchanged.
